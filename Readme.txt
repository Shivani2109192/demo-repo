This is my first git page which I am going to use.

## About Git

	Git is a distributed version control system: 
	tracking changes in any set of files, usually used 
	for coordinating work among programmers 
	collaboratively developing source code during 
	software development. Its goals include speed, data 
	integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear 
	workflows.

	Git development began in April 2005, after many 
	developers of the Linux kernel gave up access to 
	BitKeeper, a proprietary source-control management 
	(SCM) system that they had been using to maintain the 
	project since 2002.[14][15] The copyright holder of 
	BitKeeper, Larry McVoy, had withdrawn free use of the
	product after claiming that Andrew Tridgell had 
	created SourcePuller by reverse engineering the 
	BitKeeper protocols.[16] The same incident also 
	spurred the creation of another version-control 
	system, Mercurial.
